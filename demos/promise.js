// 1: Promise.resolve(value) – makes a resolved promise with the given value,
// 2: Promise.reject(error) – makes a rejected promise with the given error,
// 3: Promise.all(promises) – waits for all promises to resolve and returns an array of their results. If any of the given promises rejects, then it becomes the error of Promise.all, and all other results are ignored.
// 4: Promise.race(promises) – waits for the first promise to settle, and its result/error becomes the outcome.
